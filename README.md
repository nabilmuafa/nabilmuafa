### Hi there, Nabil here! üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I am currently having a deep interest in the world of cyber security and software engineering. I am also a Binary Exploitation CTF player, although I currently do not have any repositories about CTF. I have an ongoing CTF notes you can access [here](https://nabilmuafa.gitbook.io/notes), though.

In the meantime, this repository will be used to store my projects (if there's any) and college assignments.
